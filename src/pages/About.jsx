              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Founded in 2020, Eclipsia Game Studio was born from a shared passion for creating games that blend 
                nostalgic pixel art aesthetics with modern gameplay mechanics. Our team of developers, artists, 
                and designers work together to craft unique gaming experiences that resonate with players.

              <p className="text-gray-300">
                We believe that games are more than just entertainmentâ€”they're interactive stories that bring 
                people together, challenge minds, and create lasting memories. Every title we develop is crafted 
                with attention to detail and a deep appreciation for both retro and contemporary gaming cultures.
